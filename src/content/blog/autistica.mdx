I’ll be running the Hyde Park 10K this Saturday to raise money for Autistica, the UK’s leading autism research and campaigning charity.

More than one in 100 people are on the autism spectrum and there are around 700,000 autistic adults and children in the UK. At the same time, the autism waiting list in England surpassed 200,000 people for the first time in September 2024.

These days, formal diagnoses aren’t entirely required for someone to be deemed autistic. The increased awareness surrounding neurodivergence — and autism specifically — has enabled people to identify as autistic regardless of a diagnosis. Nonetheless, formal diagnoses are often required for reasonable adjustments in the workplace or higher education settings. This is especially crucial for adults considered to be “high-functioning” autistic individuals.\[1\]

As a matter of fact, a diagnosis is simply the first step in what we understand to be a lifelong condition. For many, the diagnosis does not merely label, but instead empowers individuals to recognise and celebrate their neurological differences and special abilities.

I began training for the upcoming 10K close to 6 weeks ago. At the time, I knew I wanted to support a charity focused on autism — ideally in adults — but hadn’t conclusively decided which one.

I’m fundraising for Autistica specifically for two reasons. Firstly, I believe addressing autism at the systemic level through inclusive research combined with advocacy is the best approach. I also believe this approach is the best way to achieve their mission of enabling autistic adults to live healthier & happier lives.

On research, their recent projects include: making public transport more accessible for neurodivergent people; using machine learning to identify patterns in autistic people’s deaths by suicide \[2\]; assessing special measures for autistic people in the criminal justice system; developing the neuroinclusion index for employers. \[3\]

On advocacy, Autistica was recently represented at the Zero Project Conference in Vienna, and at the House of Lords regarding the UK’s Autism Act. For context: both events took place within the last week.

I’m proud to support a charity dedicated to truly understanding autism from a clinical standpoint and addressing the needs of neurodivergent adults in society.

April is both Autism Awareness Month and Neurodiversity Acceptance Month, hence this fundraising effort feels particularly important.

I’d appreciate [any donations](https://justgiving.com/page/tiwa) in the run up to the 10K.\[4\] At the time of writing, we’re 60% to the £2,000 goal, but I have no doubt in my mind it’ll be achieved quite soon.

Thank you in advance.

EDIT: We reached the £2,000 goal on March 17, 2025. I'm incredibly thankful to everyone who donated or supported in some way!

\[1\] The “high-functioning” label itself is a controversial concept based on an outdated notion of the autistic spectrum as linear rather than abstract.

\[2\] Autistic individuals are up to nine times more likely to die by suicide than the general population.

\[3\] The NDEI®, Neurodiversity Employers Index, is currently the only gold-standard evidence-based tool for workplace neuroinclusion.

\[4\] No pun intended.

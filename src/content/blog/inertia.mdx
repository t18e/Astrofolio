Newton’s first law states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless a force causes the velocity to change. The interesting thing about inertia is its little downside risk: per Newton’s law, the object doesn’t simply remain unchanged, but does so in a straight line. In most cases, we choose to leave things as they are due to the low downside involved (the continued, uninterrupted straight line). Things would be different if inertia involved remaining unchanged - up to a certain point - before a rapid, catastrophic decline.

My thoughts on this were inspired by a thread on product inertia as an unforeseen occurrence when ideating or launching to market. Product inertia refers to the resistance to change or adopt new products due to familiarity, habit, or perceived effort in switching. It occurs when target users continue using a product despite seemingly 'better' alternatives; this is often driven by comfort, convenience, or fear of disruption.

The common advice regarding building products is to focus on solving problems. It’s good advice on the surface, but I fear it’s an oversimplification. Some products may solve problems — and at times even the 'right' or 'important' problems and still not be adopted. I've worked on products where people simply didn’t want what we were building and nothing we could’ve done or said short of begging them would’ve worked.



Going forward, my focus now is on low- vs high-friction channels. We spent an unnecessary amount of time trying to contact potential users undesired solutions. I realise one can’t always tell whether a solution is desired or not, but low-friction means less guesswork regarding users’ product inertia. I don’t consider the time spent on this year’s projects a waste, but my preference is always to act with conviction. Low-friction channels enable this in a much shorter timespan. Case in point: I received overwhelmingly negative feedback on Staycey, but quite promising responses with Pubbler.

I visited Copenhagen a few months ago and noticed the word 'hygge' almost everywhere. Hygge - actually pronounced 'hooga' - is both hard to pronounce and difficult to explain. As I understand it, it involves deliberate downtime, winding down and comfort - often with others. Hygge is often associated with winter, as the cold, dark and wet climate during long parts of the year encourages Danes to spend time together indoors in warm and comfortable spaces.

Hygge can be interpreted and practised differently by each individual, and I've decided to spend the better part of winter in my pyjamas. I rarely enjoy winters, but it's been far more bearable this time around. I typically spend the Christmas season in Lagos, but perhaps I'm acclimating in multiple ways.

Climate isn't the sole differentiator between spending the Christmas season in Lagos or London. Nigeria's climate is primarily tropical year-round, and this is the case across regions. The nature of festivities in Lagos specifically is characterised by abundance, opulence and decadence, underscored by religious themes of year-end gratitude.

This phenomenon, more recently known as 'Detty December', demonstrates a unique ability to compartmentalise – for better or worse – despite the nation's socioeconomic woes. 'Oblee' - pronounced 'ohblay' - was deemed the unofficial theme of this year's Detty December and speaks to this way of downtime: euphoric celebrations.

I previously dismissed this way of life as foiled attempts at escapism or driven by surface-level hedonistic desires. On a deeper level, 'hygge' and 'oblee' are different yet similar: both recognise the value of circumstance and community in the present.

Perhaps pleasure is multilinear, there isn't a single right way, and everyone is maybe better off learning from these distinct philosophies.

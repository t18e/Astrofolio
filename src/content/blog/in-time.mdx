My friend jokes that I'm working on something at any given moment. It's true, and has been the case for as long as I can recall. As I said [earlier](https://adejuyigbe.com/blog/intuit), I'm now learning the importance of choosing things to work on with a long-term focus. 

In doing so, it's become especially important to not simply consider output alone by way of ROI, but whether I am keen to work on these things day after day. It's easy for satisfaction and fulfillment to stem from releasing projects and/or products. I worry about the what next. 

Rather than chasing a big high, perhaps the satisfaction lies in navigating the micro-highs and -lows in getting from A to Z.
